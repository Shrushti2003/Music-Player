# Music-Player
#### This GitHub repository hosts an Music Player Project on C++. Welcome to my Music Player App! I've developed a music player app in C++ that allows users to play their favorite songs. To use the program, simply place your music files in the same directory as the 'main.cpp' file, ensuring the song names match those in the program. Supported audio format is '.wav.' Enjoy your music with this simple and efficient player. Thank you.
